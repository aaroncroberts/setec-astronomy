- Projection: $120k Year 1 → $400k Year 3 for Model B
- Use Faire model format as template

### 💡 Strategic Guidance

**User's explicit instruction:** "ALWAYS proceed in the strategically optimal sequence"

This means:
1. ✅ Complete ALL financial models FIRST (foundation)
2. ❌ Do NOT write narrative sections with placeholder numbers
3. ✅ THEN finalize Sections 03-06, 09 with complete financial data
4. Quality over speed

**Revenue Attribution:**
- Total 2025 revenue: $386k (all brands)
- Creamatorium (ice cream): ~$270k-$309k (70-80%) ← Business plan focus
- Other brands: ~$77k-$116k (20-30%) ← Continue independently

**Model B Core Assumptions:**
- Events: $100k-$150k baseline (proven channel, maintains presence)
- Wholesale: $120k Y1 → $400k Y3 (primary growth driver)
- Mobile: $60k Y1 → $150k Y3 (secondary growth driver)
- Total Creamatorium: $280k Y1 → $700k Y3
